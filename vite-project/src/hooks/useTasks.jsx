// Manage Task State: It maintains the overall state of tasks, like the list of tasks, current task details, etc.

// Handle Task Operations: Functions for adding, deleting, updating, and fetching tasks are implemented here.

// Interaction with API Services: If your app has a backend, useTasks would handle API calls to save, retrieve, update, or delete tasks from the server.

// Business Logic: Any logic specific to how tasks are handled, like sorting, filtering, or categorizing tasks, would be part of this hook.

// Return Values: It returns the tasks' state and the functions to manipulate them, which can be used by any component that needs to interact with tasks.
